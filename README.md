# Iranian Half Price Traffic Websites List

Iranian internet service providers (ISPs) offer discounted traffic usage calculations to users with an Iranian IP address for Iranian websites that qualify for reduced internet usage rates. The list of eligible websites can be found at https://eservices.ito.gov.ir/page/iplist.

This repository provides a script that can gather this website list and extract their domains, which can then be used as geosites for routing purposes in Project V.

The domain list is updated automatically every day and can be accessed [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IRConf/Iranian-Half-Price-Traffic-Websites-List/main/domains).
